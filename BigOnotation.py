# Big O notation
# This the measurement of how running time and space requirement complexity of an algorithm grows as as imput size increases.

# data structures
# These are containers storing data in a specific memory layout

# Arrays ara data structures were elements are stored in a contiguous memory location.
# A dictionary is a Hash Table/Map that stores data using a key and value format and it's complexity is order of 1 ie O(1) since searching through is a constant.
# it uses a key on which You apply a hash function to access a specific memory address that is connected to a given element.

# Algorithm
# This is a set of programmed instructions to accomplish a task
